### Hi there, I'm Ema 🍁🍂,
*aka Akinimaginable* 🇳🇱🇫🇷

I’m a computer student in France ~~learning databases, algorithms and system programming~~ spending all my time ricing my GNU/Linux and creating random things by aligning characters to make lines of code.
I also like design and photography, which I run a website about (mostly in french).
