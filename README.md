# Heyaaa ~, I'm Akinimaginable ✨

I’m a software developper and computer student from France ~~learning DB, algorithms and system programming~~ spending my time creating random things by aligning characters to make lines of code and ricing my GNU/Linux.

I'm interest in many different topics such as:

- Design ✏
- The open source philosophy 🌌
- GNU/Linux
- Photography 📸
- European languages 🦜
